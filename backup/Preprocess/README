These scripts are to preprocess the images, so that the eyes are centered and 
only the useful part of the image are selected for analysis.
============

face_setup     loads global vars
pad_faces      squares up the faces. this is good useful for rotating them
shift_faces    to center the eyes
rotate_faces   to align the eyes by rotation.
unpad_faces    to reduce the image size by removing border and downsampling.
support_faces  zero out unsupposed pixels.
pca_faces      run svd on faces
dump_bases     writes out average face, eigenvalues, and eigvectors
